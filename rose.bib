  abstract = {ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:/ucb/split-c/sc93.ps.Z\par Based loosely on the
  SPMD model, with global address space with a clear concept of locality,
  the languages allows a mixture of parallel paradigms (message passing,
  shared memory and data parallelism). The extensions to standard C
  include global pointers (reference objects on remote processors -
  maths such as ++ works correctly), split-phase assignment (:= allows
  comms/processing to be pipelined), signalling store (remote update
  with notification), bulk transfer and spread arrays. Using a program
  for modelling electromag waves as an example, the power of the models
  is used to show how simple optimisations improve effiicency by a
  factor of 4-5 on a 64 processor CM-5 (using ghost nodes, split phase
  comms and signalled stores).},
